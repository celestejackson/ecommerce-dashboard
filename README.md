# ecommerce-dashboard
A dashboard to analyze customer reports and product performance in an eCommerce store.

Project Overview
This project is a Python-based eCommerce Dashboard that helps businesses analyze customer purchase history and product performance. The dashboard allows eCommerce managers to search for and view customer reports, track their past purchases, and evaluate the performance of products by identifying best-sellers and underperformers in the inventory.

With this tool, eCommerce businesses can make data-driven decisions that improve inventory management, customer engagement, and overall sales performance.

Key Features
Customer Report Search:

Search for a customer by their ID and view their past purchases.
The report includes product names, quantities, total price, and order dates.
Product Performance Analytics:

View a table of best-selling and worst-selling products based on the quantity sold.
Helps businesses identify popular products to prioritize and underperforming products to either improve or phase out.
Real-time Data Processing:

The dashboard dynamically loads and processes customer and sales data from CSV files.
Data is processed using Python libraries like Pandas for data analysis and Flask for the web application.
Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

Customer Insights:
Provide eCommerce managers with easy access to customer purchase histories to help personalize marketing strategies and improve customer service.
Inventory Optimization:
Enable businesses to identify which products are performing well (best-sellers) and which need improvement (worst-sellers). This information can be used to adjust inventory and sales strategies.
Actionable Data:
Help businesses make informed decisions based on data insights. For example, if a particular product is consistently selling poorly, it may be beneficial to discontinue it or offer promotions.
How It Can Improve an eCommerce Business
Improved Inventory Management:

By identifying best-sellers and worst-sellers, eCommerce businesses can optimize their inventory. For example, stocking more of high-demand products and reducing the stock of low-performing items.
Targeted Marketing and Promotions:

Insights into customer purchase history can inform personalized marketing strategies. Targeting specific customer segments with relevant offers can increase customer retention and sales.
Better Customer Experience:

Having quick access to a customer’s purchase history allows businesses to offer better customer support and product recommendations based on past purchases. This can lead to higher customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.
Data-Driven Decisions:

Businesses can make decisions based on real-time data rather than intuition. Whether it’s adjusting inventory levels, refining product offerings, or planning marketing campaigns, the insights provided by this dashboard can lead to more informed, effective decision-making.
